[Here's an Article](https://cheesecakelabs.com/blog/using-viper-architecture-android/) that I've wrote about this subject, feel free to drop some comments!

## Template
To add the template to your Android studio you can clone this repository and run:
`$ ./moveToAndroidStudio.sh`
on your terminal.2e

<br>Then you can just create your files using the `New` menu:<br>

<br><br>This will open a configuration screen in which you can choose if you want an Activity, Fragment or Custom View, and if you want to generate the Presenter, Router, Interactor and Contracts file.

There's also a basic Base VIPER Module that your files can extend. This files add some common functionalities that can be used on your project
<br>This files are on the `Base` folder.
